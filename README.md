# NovelSentimentAnalysis
This repository is inspired by the article titled "Imageâ€“text sentiment analysis via deep multimodal attentive fusion" ([HERE](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2019.01.019)).

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a novel sentiment analysis method that considers both text and visual modalities with an attention mechanism. The method 
 and idea is based on the concepts presented in the mentioned article.

## Article
The article was mentioned above, and also uploaded in the repo, named *origin-paper.pdf*

## Methodology
The sentiment analysis method incorporates attention mechanisms for both text and visual modalities. For detailed information on the methodology, please refer to the article.

## Implementation
The code associated with this sentiment analysis method has been uploaded to this repository. However, the README does not include the code for simplicity.

## Model Framework
For the model framework, attached below
